# SOC-Challenge-1--Logical-Diagram

## Objective

The focus is on using draw.io to create a logical diagram of a cloud-based SOC environment. I will be creating and configuring six servers in future labs- Elastic/Kibana, Windows (with RDP), Ubuntu (with SSH), a Fleet server, OS Ticket, and a Command and Control (C2) 
server. The diagram is built using the Vultr cloud provider, and the environment is set up within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
The goal is to practice creating logical diagrams that reflect real-world SOC setups. Note that the aesthetic of the diagram isnâ€™t as important as gaining familiarity with the process.

### Skills Learned

-Server configuration.

-Networking within a VPC.

-Visualizing connections between servers and key components like internet gateways and SOC analyst laptops.

### Tools Used
